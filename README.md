<h2 align="center">Gender Classification and Noise Removal for Dubbed Videos</h2>

Gender classification based on voice is a crucial area of research with applications in various fields from speech recognition to filmmaking. In the film industry, having both female and male voices in dubbed movies provides a more diverse experience for the audience. However, noise can cause errors in speech recognition software which generates subtitles for audio or video content.

This study evaluates different techniques for removing noise in various noisy environments such as crowded places, motorcycle sounds, and engine running, etc. The effectiveness of these noise removal techniques was evaluated using machine learning algorithms for gender classification based on voice-based signals. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms were found to be more effective in gender classification with mean accuracy scores of 0.8715 and 0.7773, respectively.

The experiments found that DeepFilterNet was the most effective noise removal technique with a similarity score of 0.8442, followed by Noisereduce with 0.7339. Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms were less effective than SVM and KNN in gender classification.
